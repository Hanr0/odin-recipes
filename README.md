This is my first Odin project where I am going to make a simple cook book webpage.

I am not that good of a cook myself, however I do want to be one. 
So I asked my wife to pick her favorite recipes that she thinks I can handle. 

I made The page in the CSS style of the Odin project.

Later I would like to make a more dynamic site were you can select all the ingredients by seasonality.
