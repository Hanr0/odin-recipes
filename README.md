This is my first Odin project where I am going to make a simple cook book webpage.

I am not that good of a cook myself, however I do want to be one. 
So I asked my wife to pick her favorite recipes that she thinks I can handle. 

I made The page in the CSS style of the Odin project.

Later I would like to make a more dynamic site were you can select all the ingredients by when they are in season.  

Way in the future I want to make make it a webapp where I insert the ingredients of a recipe and the app web-scrapes the current prices of all ingredients at local grocery stores and lists the cheapest options.
